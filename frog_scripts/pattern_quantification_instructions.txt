### instructions quantifying pattern rotation ###

I. Gather measurements in ImageJ for manipulating image shape
1) open JPG in imageJ

2) Use the straight line tool to draw a line from the tip of the rostrum to the end of the pelvis. Use Cntrl+m to record measurements. Save measurements as a text file.
Note that the direction in which line is drawn matters (i.e. pelvis to rostrum vs rostrum to pelvis), and will cause the image to be flipped.
I draw the line in pelvis to rostrum direction.

3) Use the rectangle tool to draw a rectangle around the area that you want to crop. Save rectangle coordinates 'Save As' -> 'XY Coordinates'.

II. Rescale and Rotate pattern in R
1) Run the spatialTransform.R functions on the image

III. Remove glare and fill in pattern with GIMP
1) open the 'image_orientation_guidelines.png' in gimp. Set the guideline as the top layer and then align the image with the guideline to
double check that the standardization worked.

2) open the standardized image: 'File' -> 'Open as Layers...' 

3) Use the Free Select Tool to select the dorsum of the frog. Cntrl+i to invert selection. 'Layer' -> 'New from Visible'.
Press 'delete' to remove background (make transparent). Edit layer attributes to rename as 'black_fill'.

4) Use a combination of the Magic Wand, Free Select Tool, and the Pencil Tool to fill in pattern areas with all black.

5) Export the image as png with name sample_name_D.png

6) Select the original sample layer. 'Layer' -> 'New from Visible'. Edit layer attributes to name the new layer 'DC'.
Use the 'Free Select Tool' to select as much nonblack area of the dorsum as possible. Avoid shadows and glare.
Cntrl+i to invert selection and then press 'Delete' so that only the captured area is left.
Export the image as png with name sample_name_DC.png

7) Select the original sample layer. 'Layer' -> 'New from Visible'. Edit layer attributes to name the new layer 'LC'.
Use the 'Free Select Tool' to select as much nonblack area on rear legs as possible. Aoid shadows and glare.
Cntrl+i to invert selection and then press 'Delete' so that only the captured area is left.
Export the image as pang with name sample_name_LC.png 

IV. Calculate gap score
1) Run the rotationCombScore.R functions on the PNG image to calculate the pattern rotation in R:

gapscore <- patRotList(imageDir='/home/tyler/Dropbox/research/imitator/sanger/imi_sanger_collab/imi_pedigree_images/pedigree/Lineage9/F2/standardized_reference', imageList='sample_name_for_gapscore.txt', patcolor=c(0,0,0), gap=20, xp=0.5, yp=0.5, hmin=20, vmin=20)

2) write the table of scores

write.table(gapscore, file='L9_F2_gapscore_gap20_xp050_yp050_hmin20_vmin20', col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)

V. Calculate the average dorsal color

1) run the avgColor.R functions

dorsal_color <- avgColorList(imageDir='/home/tyler/Dropbox/research/imitator/sanger/imi_sanger_collab/imi_pedigree_images/pedigree/Lineage9/F2/standardized_reference', imageList='sample_name_for_dorsalcolor.txt', sep='\t')

2) write the table of measures

write.table(dorsal_color, file='L9_F2_dorsal_color.txt', col.names=TRUE, row.names=TRUE, quote=FALSE, sep='\t')

VI: Calculate the average leg color in Lab space:

1) run the avgColor.R functions

leg_color <- avgColorList(imageDir='/home/tyler/Dropbox/research/imitator/sanger/imi_sanger_collab/imi_pedigree_images/pedigree/Lineage9/F2/standardized_reference', imageList='sample_name_for_legcolor.txt')

2) write table of measures

write.table(leg_color, file='L9_F2_leg_color.txt', col.names=TRUE, row.names=TRUE, quote=FALSE, sep='\t')

VII: Calculate black proportion on the dorsum:

1) run the blackProportion.R functions

black <- blackList(imageDir='/home/tyler/Dropbox/research/imitator/sanger/imi_sanger_collab/imi_pedigree_images/pedigree/Lineage9/F2/standardized_reference', imageList='sample_name_for_gapscore.txt')

2) write table

write.table(black, file='L9_F2_black_proportion.txt', col.names=TRUE, row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE, sep='\t')
